A "view" contains all layout and content for a given screen.
Typically, a document only has a single view. Split views,
where a document contains two view elements are possible (see below).

A class of `.view` is required for view elements; the
following classes are optional variants:

Class                  | Description
---------------------- | ---------------------------
`view--splitList`      | Sets view to "list style" when viewport is wide enough
`view--splitDetail`    | Sets view to "detail style" when viewport is wide enough
`view--dimmed`         | Dims view (for use with modal overlays)

## Basic view (<a class="link followLink" href="pages/full-view.html">Demo</a>)
Basic example of a single view in a document:

```
<div class="view">
	<header class="view-head">
		... view-head ...
	</header>
	<main class="view-body">
		... view-body ...
	</main>
</div>
```

## Split view (DEMO)
Basic example of two views in one document, where we specify
which view has the "list" responsibility, and which view has
the "detail" responsibility.

```
<div class="view view--splitList">
	<header class="view-head">
		... view-head ...
	</header>
	<main class="view-body">
		... view-body ...
	</main>
</div>

<div class="view view--splitDetail">
	<header class="view-head">
		... view-head ...
	</header>
	<main class="view-body">
		... view-body ...
	</main>
</div>
```

	@include box-sizing(border-box);

.view--splitList, .view--splitDetail{

  &.focus{
	  display: block;
  }
}

@include atMediaUp(medium){
	.view--splitList {
		// NOTE: uses fixed position
		// try not to put forms in the split part
		// usually the split view will be a list
		position: fixed;
		top: 0;
		left: 0;
		height: 100vh;
		width: $view-minWidth;
		border-right: 1px solid $C_border;
		display: block;
	}

	.view--splitDetail {
		display: block;
		padding-left: $view-minWidth;
	}
}
